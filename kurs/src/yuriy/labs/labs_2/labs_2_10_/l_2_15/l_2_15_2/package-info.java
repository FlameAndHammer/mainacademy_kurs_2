Create new project called TestCollection2.
        Add package “com.brainacad.oop.testcollection2”.
        Create a class Main with a main() method. Add to method main() code that declares list
        variable (of List type) of string objects as LinkedList<String>.
        Write code to fill this list in loop with string values like: “num_” and number of current
        iteration (from 0 to 10). But element insertion point must be generated randomly (from
        0 to current collection length).
        Add code which iterates over list and print current element value to console.
        Execute the program.
        The program output must be like next example:
        number_5
        number_2
        number_7
        …
        number_3
