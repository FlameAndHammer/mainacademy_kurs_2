Create new project called TestCollection3.
        Add package “com.brainacad.oop.testcollection3”.
        Create a class Main with a main() method. Add to method main() code to create both an
        ArrayList and LinkedList (of String parameter type), and fill each in loop with string
        values like: “num_” and number of current iteration (from 0 to 10).
        Print each list using an ordinary Iterator. Then insert one list (ArrayList) into the other
        (LinkedList) by using an ListIterator, inserting at every other location.
        Now perform the insertion elements of the first list in reverse order, moving through the
        element from end to beginning in the second list.
        Write a static method printElements() that uses an Iterator to step through an Collection
        and print the each element value in the container.
        Execute the program
