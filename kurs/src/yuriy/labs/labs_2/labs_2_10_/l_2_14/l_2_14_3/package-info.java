Open project called TestGenerics2 (from 2-14-2 lab).
1) Rewrite a class MyTestMethod to add new generic static method calcSum (with two
parameters: an array T[] and variable maxValue of type T) that calc sum of the
number of elements in an array T[] that are greater than a specified value maxValue.
2) Add to method main() code that creates two array, first – array of Integer type and
second – array of Double type. Fill these arrays with some random values.
Add code to counts the total sum of elements in each of arrays, that are greater than
a specified element by invoking calcSum() static method.
3) Execute the program.
The program output must be like next example:
Array values: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Sum of elements that are greater than 3:
39
Array values: [1.1,2.2,3.3,4.4,5.5,6.6,7.7,8.8,9.9]
Sum of elements that are greater than 3:
46.2
