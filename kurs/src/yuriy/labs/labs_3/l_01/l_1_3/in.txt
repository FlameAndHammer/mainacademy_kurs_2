Remind that student should apply his or her knowledge of:
• how to use classes FileReader, BufferedReader;
Execute following steps:
• Student should create a new blank Java Project in IDE.
• Student should create his or her own Java class and provide all necessary code in
a method main()
• Open a FileReader and then wrap it with a BufferedReader so you can use
method readLine() to get a line of input.
• Note that readLine() strips the '\n' character off the end of the line so
use System.out.println() to split the lines out.
